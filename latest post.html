			<h2>Online Programs For 2021</h2>
			<p>Online learning has been on the rise for some time. But the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns sent its adoption rate into overdrive. Today, almost every major college in the world has integrated some form of remote learning into its traditional programs, and these new technologies are here to stay.</p>
			<br>
			<p>While this will change how current students learn and interact with each other, the growth of online learning has much broader potential. Accessible and affordable education means more people than ever can enroll in classes and programs, whatever their situation. Online education can help single parents become working professionals. It can give late bloomers a second chance at the job they've always dreamed of. And it can help those stuck in unrewarding careers make a positive change. In short, online education is removing the barriers that prevent people from becoming the best versions of themselves.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Online education is going mainstream
            A recent study found almost half of all employers see an online qualification as a big bonus during the job application process. And 58% of those surveyed either agreed or strongly agreed with the idea that people with online qualifications have a greater earning potential. Having the right technical skills is only part of the reason. Employers see an online qualification as a sign of independence, initiative, and personal responsibility.  It proves you can take control of your future, manage your time effectively, and see a task through to the end under minimal supervision. Every good company wants employees like that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Online learning creates more opportunities
            Online learning is the next big leap forward in the democratization of higher learning. In theory, it means that anyone with a laptop and a WiFi connection now has access to education and training that could change their lives for the better. What's more, education doesn't have to end when you leave college. Instead, it can be an ongoing process where you're continually developing, gaining new skills, and taking on fresh personal and career challenges. As such, we're no longer pigeonholed into one job or profession. And a previous college degree or qualification doesn't have to define your future career options anymore.</p>
